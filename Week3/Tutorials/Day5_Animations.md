# Day 5: SwiftUI Animations

## Overview
Today we'll explore the power of SwiftUI animations and transitions, learning how to create smooth and engaging user interfaces with various animation types and custom transitions.

## Topics Covered
1. Animation Types
2. Custom Transitions
3. View Modifiers
4. Animation States
5. Interactive Animations

## Key Components

### Animation Types
```swift
public enum AnimationType: String, CaseIterable {
    case easeInOut = "Ease In Out"
    case spring = "Spring"
    case linear = "Linear"
    case easeIn = "Ease In"
    case easeOut = "Ease Out"
    
    public var animation: Animation {
        switch self {
        case .easeInOut:
            return .easeInOut(duration: 0.5)
        case .spring:
            return .spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.5)
        // ... other cases
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Transition
```swift
public struct SlideTransition: ViewModifier {
    let isPresented: Bool
    
    public func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .offset(x: isPresented ? 0 : -UIScreen.main.bounds.width)
            .opacity(isPresented ? 1 : 0)
    }
}
```

### Animated Card View
```swift
public struct AnimatedCardView: View {
    @State private var isFlipped = false
    @State private var rotation: Double = 0
    
    public var body: some View {
        // Card implementation with 3D rotation
    }
}
```

## Practical Exercise
1. Create basic animations
2. Implement custom transitions
3. Build animated card view
4. Add interactive animations
5. Combine multiple animations

## Best Practices
1. Use appropriate animation types
2. Implement smooth transitions
3. Handle animation states
4. Consider performance
5. Test on different devices
