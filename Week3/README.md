# Week 3: Building a Weather App with SwiftUI

Welcome to Week 3 of the Swift Zero to Hero Bootcamp! This week focuses on building a Weather App while learning about networking, API integration, and advanced SwiftUI concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Master networking in Swift using URLSession
- Implement API integration with OpenWeatherMap
- Handle asynchronous operations with async/await
- Create beautiful weather UI with SwiftUI
- Implement location services
- Handle errors and loading states
- Cache weather data for offline access

## Next Steps
After completing Week 3, you'll have a solid understanding of:
- Networking and API integration
- Location services
- Asynchronous programming
- Advanced SwiftUI concepts
- Data persistence and caching

You'll be well-prepared to move on to Week 4's Notes App project, which will introduce Core Data and more advanced iOS features.
