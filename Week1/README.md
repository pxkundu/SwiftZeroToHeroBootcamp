# Week 1: Swift Fundamentals and SwiftUI Basics

For the **Swift Zero to Hero Bootcamp**, Week 1 is designed for absolute beginners with no prior programming experience. The focus is on building a strong foundation in Swift fundamentals and introducing SwiftUI to create a simple iOS app. Below is a high-level learning plan for Week 1, outlining key topics to be covered each day. The plan aligns with the bootcamp’s goal of taking learners from zero to building a basic app (the Counter App milestone) in a structured, beginner-friendly way.

## Week 1 Learning Plan: Swift Fundamentals and SwiftUI Basics
**Goal**: Learn core Swift programming concepts and create a simple SwiftUI app.  
**Focus**: Swift syntax, basic programming, and SwiftUI essentials.  
**Milestone**: Build a Counter App (display a number with increment/decrement buttons).  
**Duration**: 5 days (Monday–Friday), ~2–3 hours/day.  
**Tools**: Xcode 16+, Swift Playgrounds (optional), macOS Ventura or later.

### Day 1: Introduction to Swift and Xcode
- **High-Level Topics**:
  - Overview of Swift and iOS development.
  - Setting up Xcode (installation, interface, playgrounds).
  - Swift basics: Variables (`var`), constants (`let`), and data types (`Int`, `String`, `Bool`).
  - Writing and running simple Swift code in a playground.

### Day 2: Swift Control Flow and Functions
- **High-Level Topics**:
  - Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`.
  - Loops: `for`, `while`.
  - Functions: Defining, calling, parameters, and return types.
  - Writing reusable code with functions.

### Day 3: Arrays, Dictionaries, and Optionals
- **High-Level Topics**:
  - Collections: Arrays (`[String]`) and dictionaries (`[String: Int]`).
  - Optionals: Understanding `nil`, `?`, `!`, and safe unwrapping (`if let`).
  - Managing lists of data in Swift.
  - Handling missing or optional data.

### Day 4: Introduction to SwiftUI
- **High-Level Topics**:
  - SwiftUI basics: `View`, `Text`, `Button`, `@State`.
  - Creating a SwiftUI project in Xcode.
  - Building simple user interfaces with SwiftUI.
  - Running apps in the Xcode simulator.

### Day 5: Building the Counter App
- **High-Level Topics**:
  - Combining Swift and SwiftUI to build a functional app.
  - SwiftUI layout: `VStack` for vertical arrangement.
  - User interaction: Handling button taps with `@State`.
  - Testing and sharing the Counter App (simulator, GitHub, X).

### Notes
- **Beginner Focus**: Topics are kept simple, avoiding advanced concepts like closures or protocols.
- **Resources**: Leverage free materials (Hacking with Swift “100 Days of Swift,” CodeWithChris YouTube, Apple’s SwiftUI tutorials).
- **Practice**: Daily tasks include coding exercises (e.g., playgrounds for Swift, Xcode for SwiftUI) to reinforce topics.
- **Milestone**: The Counter App teaches `@State` and basic UI, setting the stage for Week 2’s To-Do List App.
