# Week 2: Building a To-Do List App with SwiftUI

Welcome to Week 2 of the Swift Zero to Hero Bootcamp! This week focuses on building a fully functional To-Do List app while learning intermediate SwiftUI concepts and data persistence.

## Learning Objectives
- Master SwiftUI Lists and Navigation
- Implement data persistence using UserDefaults
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
- Design and implement a polished user interface
- Handle user input and state management

## Daily Schedule

### Day 1: SwiftUI Lists and Navigation
- **Topics**:
  - SwiftUI List views and ForEach
  - NavigationView and NavigationLink
  - Custom row views
  - Basic data models
- **Practice**: Create a simple list view with sample todo items

  - Understanding UserDefaults
  - Codable protocol
  - Saving and loading data
  - Error handling

## Next Steps
After completing Week 2, you'll have a solid understanding of:
- Building complex SwiftUI interfaces
- Managing app state and data persistence
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Creating polished user experiences

You'll be well-prepared to move on to Week 3's Weather App project, which will introduce networking and API integration.
